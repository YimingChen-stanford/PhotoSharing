# PhotoSharing
This is a course project I did on my own(some of the codes are provided by professor of the class as starter code);

It supports the following feature:
- User can upload photos and comment on others's photos;
- User can @ mention other users in the comment. And the user mentioned will get notification upon logining;
- User can view others' front page where contains a feed section containing the recent activities of that user;
